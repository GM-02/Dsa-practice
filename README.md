“My DSA practice code — tracking my learning progress as I solve problems and improve my problem-solving skills.

💻 DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice code in Java. I use this repo to track my learning progress, stay consistent, and improve my problem-solving skills.

📚 Topics I’m Practicing

Patterns

Arrays

Strings

Linked Lists

Stacks & Queues

Recursion

Trees

Graphs

Sorting & Searching

Dynamic Programming

Greedy Algorithms

🎯 Goal

Build a strong foundation in DSA

Solve problems from beginner to advanced level

Prepare for coding interviews I add solutions daily and organize them by topic so I can review them easily later.
